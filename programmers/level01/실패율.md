## solution 1

```python
def solution(N, stages):
    answer = []
    people = len(stages)
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        cnt = stages.count(i)
        if people == 0:
            answer.append((i,0))
            continue
        answer.append((i ,cnt / people) )
        people -= cnt
    
    answer.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1]) 
    return [a[0] for a in answer]
```

## solution 2

```python

        cnt = stages.count(i)
        if people == 0:
            answer[i] = 0
            continue
        answer[i] = cnt / people
        people -= cnt
    
    return sorted(answer , key = lambda x :answer[x] , reverse=True)
