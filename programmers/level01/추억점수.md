## solution 1

```python
from collections import defaultdict
def solution(name, yearning, photo):
    answer = []
    d = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(len(name)):
        n,y = name[i], yearning[i]
        d[n] = y
    for p in photo:
        s = 0
        for name in p:
            s += d[name]
        answer.append(s)
    return answer
```

## solution 2 list comprehension

```python
def solution(names, yearning, photos):
    return [sum(yearning[names.index(name)] for name in photo if name in names) for photo in photos]
```
