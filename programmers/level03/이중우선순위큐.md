## solution 1

```python
import heapq
def solution(operations):
    max_heap = []
    min_heap = []
    cnt = 0
    for operation in operations:
        op = operation.split(" ")
        if op[0] == "I":
            heapq.heappush(min_heap,int(op[1]))
            heapq.heappush(max_heap,-int(op[1]))
            cnt +=1
        else:
            if cnt == 0:
                continue
            if op[1] == "1":
                heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            else:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
            cnt -=1

    if cnt == 0: return [0,0]
    return [-heapq.heappop(max_heap) , heapq.heappop(min_heap)]
