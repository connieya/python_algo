## solution 1

```python
from collections import deque
def solution(cacheSize, cities):
    answer = 0
    if cacheSize == 0: 
        return len(cities)*5
    q = deque()
    for city in cities:
        city = city.lower()
        if not q:
            answer +=5
            q.append(city)  
            continue     
        if city in q:
            q.remove(city)
            q.append(city)
            answer +=1
        elif city not in q:
            if len(q) >= cacheSize:
                q.popleft()
            q.append(city)
            answer += 5
    return answer
```


## solution 2

```python
from collections import deque
def solution(cacheSize, cities):
    answer = 0
    q =deque(maxlen = cacheSize)
    for city in cities:
        city = city.lower()
        if city in q:
            q.remove(city)
            q.append(city)
            answer += 1
        else:
            q.append(city)
            answer+=5
    return answer
