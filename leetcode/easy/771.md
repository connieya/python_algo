        for char in stones:
            if char not in dict:
                dict[char] = 1
            else:
                dict[char] += 1
        
        for char in jewels:
            if char in dict:
                answer += dict[char]
        
        return answer
```

## soltuion 2

class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        dict = collections.defaultdict(int)
        answer = 0
        for char in stones:
            dict[char] += 1

        return answer
        
```

## solution 3

```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        dict = collections.Counter(stones)
        answer = 0
        for char in jewels:
            answer += dict[char]
        
        return answer
        
```
