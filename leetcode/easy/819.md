        words = [word for word in re.sub(r'[^\w]' ,' ',paragraph)
                 .lower()
                 .split() if word not in banned]
        
        counts = collections.Counter(words)
        return counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
        
```

## solution 2

```python

class Solution:
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph: str, banned: List[str]) -> str:
       paragraph  = paragraph.lower()
       words = []
       for pp in paragraph.split():
           for p in pp.split(','):
               if p and p[-1].isalpha() and p not in banned:
                   words.append(p)
               elif p and  not p[-1].isalpha() and  p[:-1] not in banned :
                    words.append(p[:-1])
               
       cnts = collections.Counter(words)
       return cnts.most_common(1)[0][0]
